##### Parametric synths in Pure Data based on Perry Cook &amp; Gary Scavone's Synthesis Toolkit ([STK](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/)).

There are two versions of the patches:
1. As an abstraction to be used as an object in your patch.
2. As a GUI specifically designed to be used with [AUTOMATONISM](https://www.automatonism.com/)
